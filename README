py3exiv2
*******

Welcome to py3exiv2, a python 3 binding to exiv2 (http://exiv2.org/), the C++
library for manipulation of EXIF, IPTC and XMP image metadata.
It is a python 3 module that allows your python scripts to read and write
metadata (EXIF, IPTC, XMP, thumbnails) embedded in image files
(JPEG, TIFF, ...).

Point your browser to http://exiv2.org/metadata.html for the complete metadata
tag reference.
